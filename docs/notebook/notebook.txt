* Use of Hugepages in the Linux Environment
Hugepage support is required for the large memory pool allocation used for packet buffers 
(the HUGETLBFS option must be enabled in the running kernel as indicated the previous section).
By using hugepage allocations, performance is increased since fewer pages are needed,
and therefore less Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs, high speed translation caches),
which reduce the time it takes to translate a virtual page address to a physical page address.
Without hugepages, high TLB miss rates would occur with the standard 4k page size, slowing
performance.

** Reserving Hugepages for DPDK Use

This is done by echoing the number of hugepages required to a nr_hugepages file
in the /sys/kernel/ directory corresponding to a specific page size (in Kilobytes).

For a single-node system, the command to use is as follows(assuming that 1024 of 2MB pages are required):
 $ echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
 
On a NUMA machine, the above command will usually divide the number of hugepages equallyacross all NUMA nodes
(assuming there is enough memory on all NUMA nodes).
However, pages can also be reserved explicitly on individual NUMA nodes using a nr_hugepages file in the /sys/devices/ directory:

$ echo 1024 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
$ echo 1024 > /sys/devices/system/node/node1/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages

The tool dpdk-hugepages.py can be used to manage hugepages.
